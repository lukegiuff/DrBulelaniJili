This publication examines the growing trend of Chinese surveillance technology adoption across developing nations, with particular focus on how these systems are marketed as technological solutions to complex social and political challenges.

## Key Findings

- Governments often adopt Chinese surveillance systems without adequate consideration of privacy implications
- Technology transfer agreements frequently lack transparency
- Local adaptation of surveillance systems varies significantly by context
- Digital sovereignty concerns are emerging as a key policy issue

## Methodology

The research employs comparative case study analysis across multiple countries, examining policy documents, procurement records, and expert interviews to understand the decision-making processes behind surveillance technology adoption.

## Policy Implications

The findings suggest a need for stronger regulatory frameworks governing surveillance technology procurement and implementation, particularly in contexts with limited digital rights protections.
