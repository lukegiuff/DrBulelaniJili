Dr. Bulelani Jili's latest analysis in the **East Asia Forum** explores the nuanced ways African nations are engaging with Chinese surveillance technologies, moving beyond simple narratives of dependency to examine how local actors are adapting and reshaping these systems.

## Key Insights

The analysis challenges conventional wisdom about technology transfer, showing how African governments and civil society organizations are actively engaging with surveillance technologies rather than passively receiving them.

### Local Adaptation Strategies

- **Selective Implementation**: African governments are choosing specific components of surveillance systems while rejecting others
- **Regulatory Innovation**: New legal frameworks are emerging to govern surveillance technology use
- **Civil Society Engagement**: Local organizations are playing crucial roles in shaping technology deployment

## Broader Implications

This research contributes to ongoing debates about digital colonialism and technological sovereignty, suggesting a more complex picture of South-South technology transfer than previously understood.
